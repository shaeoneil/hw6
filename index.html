    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p> I am currently a senior at the University of Iowa studying 
        Business analytics with a minor in sports recreation and management. 
        I am also an undergrad to graduate studentwhich means that while completing
         my bachelors degree, I am also  taking master level courses to finish 
         my master of science degree in business analytics at an accelerated rate. 
         Taking these master level courses during my undergrad has allowed me to gain a deeper 
         understanding of the industry. I will be graduating Spring 2022 with my BBA 
         in Business Analytics and in Spring 2023 with my MS in Business Analytics. You
         can find my current and past courses I have taken here: <a href="schedule.html"> Courses </a>
